5. What will be the output of the following Java code?

    class exception_handling 
    {
        public static void main(String args[]) 
        {
            try 
            {
                int a = args.length;
                int b = 10 / a;
                System.out.print(a);
                try 
                {
                    if (a == 1)
                        a = a / a - a;
                    if (a == 2) 
                    {
                        int []c = {1};
                        c[8] = 9;
                    }
                }
                catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException e) 
                {
                    System.out.println("TypeA");
                }
                catch (ArithmeticException e) 
                {
                    System.out.println("TypeB");
                }
            }
        }
    }
a) TypeA
b) TypeB
c) Compile Time Error
d) 0TypeB

6. What will be the output of the following Java code?

    class exception_handling 
    {
        public static void main(String args[]) 
        {
            try 
            {
                System.out.print("A");
                throw new NullPointerException ("Hello");
            }
            catch(ArithmeticException e) 
            {
                System.out.print("B");        	
            }
        }
    }
a) A
b) B
c) Hello

	at exception_handling.main
7. What will be the output of the following Java code?

advertisement
public class San 
 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        try 
        { 
            return; 
        } 
        finally 
        {
            System.out.println( "Finally" ); 
        } 
    } 
}
a) Finally
b) Compilation fails
c) The code runs with no output
d) An exception is thrown at runtime
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Because finally will execute always.
8. What will be the output of the following Java code?

public class San 
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        try 
        {
            System.out.print("Hello world ");
        }
        finally 
        {
            System.out.println("Finally executing ");
        }
    }
}
a) The program will not compile because no exceptions are specified
b) The program will not compile because no catch clauses are specified
c) Hello world
d) Hello world Finally executing
