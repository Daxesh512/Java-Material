    {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws UnknownHostException

        }
    }
a) 0
b) 1
c) true
d) false
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: InetAddress obj1 = InetAddress.getByName(“cisco.com”); creates object obj1 having DNS and IP address of cisco.com, InetAddress obj2 = InetAddress.getByName(“sanfoundry.com”); creates obj2 having DNS and IP address of sanfoundry.com, since both these address point to two different locations false is returned by obj1.equals(obj2);.
Output:
advertisement

$ javac networking.java
$ java networking 
false
