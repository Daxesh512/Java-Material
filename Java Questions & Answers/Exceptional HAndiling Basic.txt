6. What will be the output of the following Java program?

    class exception_handling 
    {
        public static void main(String args[]) 
        {
            try 
            {
                System.out.print("Hello" + " " + 1 / 0);
            }
            catch(ArithmeticException e) 
            {
        	System.out.print("World");        	
            }
        }
    }
a) Hello
b) World
c) HelloWorld
d) Hello World
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: System.ou.print() function first converts the whole parameters into a string and then prints, before “Hello” goes to output stream 1 / 0 error is encountered which is cached by catch block printing just “World”.
Output:
$ javac exception_handling.java
$ java exception_handling
World

7. What will be the output of the following Java program?

           {
                int a, b;
                b = 0;
                a = 5 / b;
                System.out.print("A");
            }
            catch(ArithmeticException e) 
            {
        	System.out.print("B");

                System.out.print("A");
            }
            catch(ArithmeticException e) 
            {
        	System.out.print("B");        	
            }
            finally

9. What will be the output of the following Java program?

    class exception_handling 
    {
        public static void main(String args[]) 
        {
            try 
            {
                int i, sum;
                sum = 10;
                for (i = -1; i < 3 ;++i)
                    sum = (sum / i);
            }
            catch(ArithmeticException e) 
            {
        	System.out.print("0");        	
            } 
            System.out.print(sum);
        }
    }
a) 0
b) 05
c) Compilation Error
d) Runtime Error
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Value of variable sum is printed outside of try block, sum is declared only in try block, outside try block it is undefined.
Output:
$ javac exception_handling.java
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: 
	sum cannot be resolved to a variable
